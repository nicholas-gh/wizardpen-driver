This document describes how to configure the Wizardpen driver.

CONFIGURING THE DRIVER
----------------------
** RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION STEPS FOR XORG 7.3 **

To fully exploit HAL-based hotplugging provided in Xorg 7.3, the following
steps should be observed:
    1. Connect your Wizardpen tablet
    2. ** IMPORTANT ** Find out the name of your tablet by executing
        `grep -i name /proc/bus/input/devices`
    3. Create a new file /etc/hal/fdi/policy/99-x11-wizardpen.fdi
    4. Edit the fdi file and paste the following template:
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
            <deviceinfo version="0.2">
            <device>
                <!-- This MUST match with the name of your tablet obtained -->
                <!-- in Step 2 specified previously                        -->
                <match key="info.product" contains="NAME OF YOUR TABLET">
                <merge key="input.x11_driver" type="string">wizardpen</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.SendCoreEvents" type="string">true</merge>

                <!-- Modify these configuration accordingly -->
                <!-- See CONFIGURATION OPTIONS section for the full-set of -->
                <!-- configurable options                                  -->
                <merge key="input.x11_options.TopX" type="string">5619</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.TopY" type="string">6554</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.BottomX" type="string">29405</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.BottomY" type="string">29671</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.MaxX" type="string">29405</merge>
                <merge key="input.x11_options.MaxY" type="string">29671</merge>
                </match>
            </device>
            </deviceinfo> 
    5. Restart your computer

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
----------------------
Note: The following tries to follow the same description convention used in
      Xorg.conf manpage

Option "TopX" "string"
    Specifies the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the tablet.
    This value can be obtained using the `wizardpen-calibrate` program
    included with the driver

Option "TopY" "string"
    Specifies the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the tablet.
    This value can be obtained using the `wizardpen-calibrate` program
    included with the driver

Option "BottomX" "string"
    Specifies the x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the tablet.
    This value can be obtained using the `wizardpen-calibrate` program
    included with the driver

Option "BottomY" "string"
    Specifies the y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the tablet.
    This value can be obtained using the `wizardpen-calibrate` program
    included with the driver

Option "TopZ" "string"
    Specifies the minimum pressure threshold. When the pressure reaches over
    this level, the driver will:
        1. Send a left-click event
        2. Send pressure values greater than one (for graphical applications)

    This is VERY USEFUL if your pen tip gets "stuck" and continues to send
    non-zero values when you are not pressing it. Set this value ABOVE the
    stuck value. Find stuck value (if any) by executing `xinput test Tablet`

    Accepts values between 0 and 1024.

Option "BottomZ" "string"
    Specifies the maximum pressure value. When the driver receives presure
    value higher than this value, it will a pressure value of 1024 - which
    translates to maximum pressure in graphics applications

Option "Rotate90" "boolean"
    Rotate tablet 90 degrees clockwise

Option "ScreenX" "width"
    Tells the driver the width of the screen. If you want to know what the
    driver thinks your screen dimesions are, execute `xinput list Tablet`.

Option "ScreenY" "height"
    Tells the driver the height of the screen. If you want to know what the
    driver thinks your screen dimesions are, execute `xinput list Tablet`.

Option "debugyn" "boolean"
    Generates event info into Xorg log file (Xorg.0.log).
    ** WARNING ** Don't switch the option on unless you need to as the
    debug information is very verbose.

Option "MouseSpeed" "multiplier"
    (Relative Mode only?) The scaling factor multiplied by the relative mouse
    movement events to calculate absolute x/y movements. Defaults to "30" if
    not specified.

Option "MouseAccel" "boolean"
    Turns mouse acceleration on or off.
